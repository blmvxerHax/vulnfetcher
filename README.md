# Vulnfetcher
Checks a filelist (generated by 'dpkg -l > file') against known vulnerabilities, by searching websites and scoring the results

# Expectations
I am not a coder... I just thought this would help me in my work. I don't plan on impoving this, unless I see a strong need myself.
If any real coder would like to contribute to this: by all means, please do!
