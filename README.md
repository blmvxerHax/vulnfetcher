# Vulnfetcher
A rudimentary vulnerability scanner for installed debian packages. It checks a filelist (generated by 'dpkg -l > file') against known vulnerabilities, by searching websites and scoring the results.

## Word of caution: 
This tool webscrapes google, which is against their policies. This tool does it with a fairly big pause in between searches, but still: using this tool might might ban you (temporarily) from google. Obviously this is written for conceptual reasons and I do not endorse that you use it, nor do I take responsibility if you do.

## Expectations
I am not a coder... I just thought this would help me in my work. Coding is more something I do out of a need, so I don't plan on improving this. Bugreports and feauture requests will therefore probably stay unanswered.

If any real coder would like to contribute to this: by all means, please do!
